# Introduction

This repository is used for publishing code samples from my study at University of Ljubljana - Faculty for computer sciences and informatics. It is not a complete set of all the work done, but is enough to showcase my coding skills. Included are mostly second year classes and for the time being mostly only include Slovene instructions.
